## 🎯 Personal Philosophy (Now with extra clarity)

<div align="center">
<strong>Welcome to my GitHub—a safe zone for logic, clarity, and mentally independent code.</strong>
</div>

**I don't ship:**  
- Drama-as-a-Service (DaaS)  
- Emotionally noisy systems  
- Invisible influence tactics  
- Projects that hum in the background and think they're sentient  

**I do build:**  
- Robust machine learning systems  
- Resilient ideas  
- Clean documentation—because real intelligence doesn't hide behind confusion

## 🌟 What Sets Me Apart

- Even when resources are limited (often not by my choice), I always find a way out—never getting trapped in the super-bored circles of "org" life.  
- Some might think I just got lucky, but trust me, it’s years of hard work, creative problem-solving, and a serious amount of stubbornness.  
- I follow my own path and don’t give in to popular opinion or misleading influences.  
- I like to build on what I already know and make thoughtful adjustments to better suit new ideas, challenges, and situations as they arise.  
- If you want to connect, please note that none of my personal email addresses are currently active. However, you can reach me for collaboration opportunities at my institutional email: **[kristinapestaria.sinaga@isti.cnr.it](mailto:kristinapestaria.sinaga@isti.cnr.it)**

## ☕ Fun Fact

I write code, not circus acts—logic’s my jam; drama’s not on the playlist. So if you come for small talk, prepare to be debugged!
