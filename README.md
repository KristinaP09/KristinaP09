**Thriving beyond noise. I write code, not circus scripts. Subtle where it counts, and allergic to performative nonsense.**

---

- I am a lifelong learner, not a people pleaser.  
- I avoid performance disguised as competence—and yes, that includes both corporate drama and invisible clown syndicates.  
- 「 ✦ 𝐍𝐚𝐦𝐞 ✦ 」My Chinese name (given by CYCU) is 許蒂娜 (Xǔ dì nà).

## 🎯 Personal Philosophy (Now with extra clarity)

Welcome to my GitHub—a safe zone for logic, clarity, and mentally independent code.

**I don’t ship:**
- Drama-as-a-Service (DaaS)  
- Emotionally noisy systems  
- Invisible influence tactics  
- Projects that hum in the background and think they’re sentient  

**I do build:**
- Robust machine learning systems  
- Resilient ideas  
- Clean documentation—because real intelligence doesn’t hide behind confusion  

---

## 🛡️ Current Status

- Documenting what others only dare to whisper  
- Thriving with structure  
- Still ignoring clowns, humming upstairs
