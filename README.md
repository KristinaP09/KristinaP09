- I am a lifelong learner, not a people pleaser, and always try to avoid people who show off (usually I dont care about it much).
- I have worked on various unsupervised learning techniques, including clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection. In my most recent project, I developed a new approach to clustering that leverages federated learning to enable multi-view k-means (MVKM) and multi-view fuzzy c-means (MVFCM) addressing multiple clients' multi-view data.
