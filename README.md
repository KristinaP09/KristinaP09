## 🌍 Availability

I am open to global opportunities and will be available for new roles starting **October 2025**. If you are looking for expertise in machine learning, edge AI, or distributed systems, feel free to connect!

> **For organizations interested in learning more about my background, please refer to my [Resume](https://kristinap09.github.io/pdf/cv/index.html) & [CV](https://kristinap09.github.io/pdf/my_cv.pdf).**

## 🎯 Personal Philosophy (Now with extra clarity)

<div align="center">
  
> ### Welcome to my GitHub—a safe zone for logic, clarity, and mentally independent code.
  
</div>

**I don't ship:**
- Drama-as-a-Service (DaaS)  
- Emotionally noisy systems  
- Invisible influence tactics  
- Projects that hum in the background and think they're sentient  

**I do build:**
- Robust machine learning systems  
- Resilient ideas  
- Clean documentation—because real intelligence doesn't hide behind confusion

## 🌟 What Sets Me Apart

- Even when resources are limited (often not by my choice), I always find a way out—never getting trapped in the super-bored circles of "org" life.
- Some call me "a lucky person"—I call it creative problem-solving and resilience.
- I do things my way. I don't listen to crowds or follow the misguidance of clowns.
- As long as I breathe, I'm open to learning—curiosity is my default mode.
- Want to connect? My contact information is in my [Resume](https://kristinap09.github.io/pdf/cv/index.html) and [CV](https://kristinap09.github.io/pdf/my_cv.pdf). Take a look and figure it out yourself.
- AI makes me accidentally smart in many ways (and I embrace it).

## 🛡️ Current Status

- Documenting what others only dare to whisper  
- Thriving with structure  
- Still ignoring clowns, humming upstairs
